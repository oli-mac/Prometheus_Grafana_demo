# Observability Stack: Promtail, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana

This README provides instructions for setting up an observability stack using Promtail, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana. This stack enables you to collect logs, monitor metrics, and visualize the data in Grafana.

## Prerequisites

- Go to the [Loki releases page](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases) and download the latest version of **Promtail**.
- Go to the [Prometheus website](https://prometheus.io/download/) and download the latest version of **Prometheus**.
- Go to the [Grafana website](https://grafana.com/get) and download the latest version of **Grafana**.
- Ensure you have **Docker** or **Docker Compose** installed if you plan to use containers.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install and Configure Promtail

1. **Create a Configuration File:**
   Create a file named `promtail.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   server:
     http_listen_port: 9080
     grpc_listen_port: 9095

   positions:
     filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

   clients:
     - url: http://<loki_host>:3100/loki/api/v1/push  # Replace <loki_host> with your Loki instance

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: system
       static_configs:
         - targets:
             - localhost
           labels:
             job: varlogs
             __path__: /var/log/*.log  # Adjust this path to your log files
   ```

2. **Start Promtail:**
   Run the following command in the directory where `promtail` is located:

   ```bash
   ./promtail -config.file=promtail.yml
   ```

### 2. Install and Configure Prometheus

1. **Create a Configuration File:**
   Create a file named `prometheus.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'your_application'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['<your_application_host>:<port>']  # Replace with your application's host and port
   ```

2. **Start Prometheus:**
   Run the following command in the directory where `prometheus` is located:

   ```bash
   ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
   ```

### 3. Install and Configure Grafana

1. **Start Grafana:**
   Follow the instructions for your platform to start Grafana.

2. **Add Loki as a Data Source:**
   - Go to **Configuration** → **Data Sources** → **Add data source** → **Loki**.
   - Enter the URL where Loki is running (e.g., `http://<loki_host>:3100`).

3. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source:**
   - Go to **Configuration** → **Data Sources** → **Add data source** → **Prometheus**.
   - Enter the URL where Prometheus is running (e.g., `http://<prometheus_host>:9090`).

### 4. Verify the Setup

- Ensure **Promtail** is sending logs to **Loki**.
- Ensure **Prometheus** is scraping metrics from your application.
- In Grafana, create dashboards to visualize metrics from Prometheus and logs from Loki.

## Additional Notes

- Adjust the paths in the configuration files according to your environment.
- You can customize the `scrape_configs` section in both Prometheus and Promtail configurations to suit your specific requirements.
- For further reading and advanced configurations, refer to the official documentation:
  - [Promtail Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/)
  - [Prometheus Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)

### Instructions for Use
1. Create a new file named `README.md` in your project directory.
2. Copy and paste the above content into the file.
3. Adjust any placeholders (like `<loki_host>` and `<your_application_host>`) as needed.
4. Save the file, and your documentation will be ready for others to understand how to set up the observability stack.
